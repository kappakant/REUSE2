Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-11 13:44:40.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.3E-15
574 states generated, 140 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 7.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 4).
