# Carini

Carini (Compositionally Arranged INductive Invariants) is a tool for inductive invariant inference in the TLA+ formal specification language.
Carini is based on *fully compositional* inductive invariant inference, a novel technique that we are currently researching.
Currently, this repository houses code for synthesizing formulaic assumptions for components of a protocol, which are then passed to [Endive](https://github.com/will62794/endive) for inferring a local inductive invariant.
